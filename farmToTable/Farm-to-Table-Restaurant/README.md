1.Responsive Design: A responsive website design means that the website will automatically adjust to fit the size and screen resolution of the device being used to access it. This ensures that the website is user-friendly and easy to navigate on a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile device.

2.Slideshow: A slideshow is an excellent way to showcase high-quality images of the restaurant, the farm where the ingredients are sourced from, and the dishes being served. A slideshow can be easily created using HTML and CSS, and JavaScript can be used to add additional features such as automatic transitions and user controls.

3.Photo Gallery: A photo gallery is another way to showcase the quality of the ingredients and dishes being served at the restaurant. A gallery can be created using HTML and CSS, and JavaScript can be used to add features such as lightboxes, image overlays, and image zooming.

4.Google Maps Location: Embedding a Google Maps location on the website can make it easy for customers to find the restaurant and get directions. This can be done by using the Google Maps API and integrating it into the website using JavaScript.

5.QR Code for UPI Payment: QR codes can be used to facilitate UPI payments. A QR code can be generated for each transaction, and customers can scan the code using their mobile phones to complete the payment. This can be done by integrating a third-party payment gateway and generating QR codes dynamically using JavaScript.

In summary, a Farm to Table restaurant website designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be an effective way to showcase the quality of the ingredients and dishes being served. The inclusion of features such as a slideshow, photo gallery, Google Maps location, and QR codes for UPI payments can enhance the user experience and make the website more user-friendly.
